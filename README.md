Detecting Cancer using Deep Learning

This project explores the application of Deep Learning techniques in the classification of breast cancer using histopathological images.The primary objective of this project is to develop a Deep Learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant breast cancer tissue from digitized histopathological images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically tailored architectures are constructed and trained on a dataset comprising a substantial collection of annotated breast tissue images.
